            <p className='about-me-description'>
            Originally from the outskirts of <span className='purple-text-description'>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</span>, 
            I am currently immersed in the world of technology and innovation at the 
            <span className='purple-text-description'> University of Maryland, College Park</span>, and am on track to 
            graduate in <span className='purple-text-description'> May 2025</span>. 
            <br></br><br></br>

            As a dedicated developed, I enjoy crafting <span className='purple-text-description'> elegant </span>

            thus far been accompanied with a number of personal projects that not only help to chellenge my 
            understanding but also <span className='purple-text-description'> amplify my skills </span> 
            in software development.
            <br></br><br></br>

            Outside of programming, I enjoy competing on the <span className='purple-text-description'>soccer </span>
            field and in the virtual realms of <span className='purple-text-description'>video games</span>.
            Just as much as I take pleasure in a thrilling match or engaging gameplay session, I equally savor 
            the journey of learning on platforms like <span className='purple-text-description'>YouTube</span>.

            As I naviagte through my education at the <span className='purple-text-description'>University of Maryland</span>, 
            I'm always looking for the next <span className='purple-text-description'>challenge </span>  to tackle or 
            problem to solve. Each project is an opportunity to showcase my <span className='purple-text-description'> creativity and innovative mind </span> . Every 
            line of code is a step towards the future in which 
            I am <span className='purple-text-description'> eager </span> to help build.
