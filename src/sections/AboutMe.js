            <p className='about-me-description'>
            Originally from the outskirts of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, I am currently immersed in the world
            of technology and innovation at the University of Maryland, College Park, and am on track to 
            graduate in May 2025. <br></br><br></br>

            As a dedicated developed, I enjoy crafting elegant solutions through code. My academic journey has
            thus far been accompanied with a number of personal projects that not only help to chellenge my 
            understanding but also amplify my skills in software development.<br></br><br></br>

            Outside of programming, I enjoy competing on the soccer field and in the virtual realms of video games.
            Just as much as I take pleasure in a thrilling match or engaging gameplay session, I equally savor 
            the journey of learning on platforms like YouTube. <br></br><br></br>

            As I naviagte through my education at the University of Maryland, I'm always looking for the next
            challenge to tackle or problem to solve. Each project is an opportunity to showcase my creativity
            and innovative mind. Every line of code is a step towards the future in which I am eager to help
            build.
